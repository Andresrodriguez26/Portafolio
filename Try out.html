                <p>
                    Hello i'm Andres Rodriguez, i'm glad to welcome you to my portafolio,
                    i'd like to share a little bit about my self and what drives me. I'm a reator and work with real estate
                    investments since almost two years and a half now, i started from scratch and then
                    started gaining more knowladge, meeting more people, investors and clients, up to a point
                    where it just didn't feel like it was my job. However
                    My fascination with coding it's been always there, i've  been the kind of person who enjoys fixing, solving, and 
                    upagrading things. I'm really excited about this new path in coding, and also willing to put all the effort and time 
                    to master this amazing world of programming.
                    Somethings that i really enjoy apart from work are, playing soccer, attending networking events, 
                    videogames, share with family, and also meet new places.

                alt="Web Development Picture"

                <h3 class="sub-title"> Why a Developer ?</h3>
                <p>
                    I think there's nothing more satisfactory than being able 
                    to develop and create something from scratch and see the results
                    after putting all the work together. I believe being a software engeeniring gives you 
                    all the knowladge and tools to do so, i'd love being able to create and represent what people want
                    but also adding my touch. 
                </p>
